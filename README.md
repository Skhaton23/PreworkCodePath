4. Watching my younger cousins spending most of their time on social media has made me reflect upon my childhood. I would spend my time learning creative work and participating in leisure activities to broaden my skills. I want to use technology to replace children’s daily activities with more creative work. I want to build an app that specifically targets children and will allow children to gain artistic skills at a young age. I like the game “Dumb Ways to Die” because it has entertaining characters with unique games that promote safety awareness. I want to create a similar game that promotes creativity through the medium of game. I want to add five labels and below those labels there will be games  that users can scroll through and click to play. These labels are sewing and it has bunch of games underneath it that teaches various sewing stitches using sewing machine, DIY (Do-It-Yourself) Project games that will requires users to collect recycled items to build fun projects ultimately teaching them about sustainability,  sketching games that teaches simple drawings, a map games that teach about different countries, and lastly a music games that teaches how to play musical instrument. In addition, I want to have a  feature that keeps track of points and users can use their points to unlock higher level games. I want to implement this game using features like textfield, sliders, activity indicator view, image view, and buttons. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some challenges I encountered was not being able to run the app due making errors on the code, having hard times finding certain functions, navigating Xcode,and having hard times updating my computers software to match Xcode versions.
